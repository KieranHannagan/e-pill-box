  ## Description
  E-pillbox is a full stack MERN application that allows users to keep track of their medication usage. It presents all of your medication info 
  in a single place and allows you to see when you got it filled, what pharmacy you got it filled at, if you have taken it today, and the quantity you have left.

  ## Installation 
  If you would like to demo the app, you can do so on our live server (refer to [Usage](#usage)).

  
  If you would like to use this application locally, you can do so by running a `git clone` into your preferred shell. You can then install the required dependencies with an `npm install` from the root directory. This application uses `concurrently` to run the client and the server simultaneously (refer to `package.json`).
  
  ## Usage 
 If you would like to demo the app, you can do so on our live [server](https://pure-harbor-43860.herokuapp.com/). 

  To use this app locally, you will have to run the following in your command line from the root application: 

                npm run build
                npm run seed 
                (this is to seed your database, refer to  /server/seeders)
                npm run develop
                (this is to start your apollo & react servers)
You will then be ready to use the E-pillbox, simply navigate to your local host port (see `/server/server.js`) and start tracking your meds!
